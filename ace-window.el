;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The main function, `ace-window' is meant to replace `other-window'
;; by assigning each window a short, unique label.  When there are only
;; two windows present, `other-window' is called (unless
;; aw-dispatch-always is set non-nil).  If there are more, each
;; window will have its first label character highlighted.  Once a
;; unique label is typed, ace-window will switch to that window.
;;
;; To setup this package, just add to your .emacs:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'ace-window)
;;
;; replacing "M-o"  with an appropriate shortcut.
;;
;; By default, ace-window uses numbers for window labels so the window
;; labeling is intuitively ordered.  But if you prefer to type keys on
;; your home row for quicker access, use this setting:
;;
;;    (setq aw-keys '(?a ?s ?d ?f ?g ?h ?j ?k ?l))
;;
;; Whenever ace-window prompts for a window selection, it grays out
;; all the window characters, highlighting window labels in red.  To
;; disable this behavior, set this:
;;
;;    (setq aw-background nil)
;;
;; If you want to know the selection characters ahead of time, turn on
;; `ace-window-display-mode'.
;;
;; When prefixed with one `universal-argument', instead of switching
;; to the selected window, the selected window is swapped with the
;; current one.
;;
;; When prefixed with two `universal-argument', the selected window is
;; deleted instead.
